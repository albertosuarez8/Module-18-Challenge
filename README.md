## Description

I created an API that enables users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I made sure to keep in mind the RESTful API design principles and leveraged my technical skills to implement such an API. My API was user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the application. Additionally, I made sure that the API was secure, reliable, and scalable.
